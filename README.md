# SOME2_decisionTrees
This is the code used to make the animations for the video at www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0fpXEIAzwk .<br/>
The code is organised in .py files each containing a portion of the animation. If you are looking for a particular bit,
you can use this table matching the video's timestamp to the name of the .py file and its corresponding description comment :
